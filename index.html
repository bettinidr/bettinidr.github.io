<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>NASCAR Project Simulation is an application that was made to 
	simulate the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season using random number generators.
	The application records various statistics from the simulated results, such as 
	average finish, number of wins, number of top 5 finishes, and number of top 10
	finishes. In addition, the application provides historical data for drivers and 
	updates it according to the simulation.

<h2>Using the application</h2>
<img src = "ResultsAfterDaytona.png" alt = "What the application looks like" height = "350" width = "500">
<p>The program is very easy to use and manage. The picture above is what the application
looks like after the first race is run. Clicking the button labeled "race" will simulate one race. There are three options in the menu: Simulation 
Options, Manage Simulation, and About.</p>

<img src = "Chase.png" alt = "Option1" height = "100" width = "250">
<p> 
The Chase is NASCAR's 2016 playoff format, where the last 10 races are broken up into 4 rounds. 
The first 3 rounds are 3 races long, with the final round being 1 race. The top 16 drivers
make the playoffs, with 4 drivers being eliminated every round until there are 4 drivers left
to decide the championship. The points are reset for the playoff drivers after each round. 
<br>
<br>
Clicking on the "Similation Options" tab will bring up the option to disable or enable it. 
The Chase is enabled by default. This tab should only be accessed before the start of a new 
season.
</p>
<img src = "StartNewSeason.png" alt = "Start new season" height = "100" width = "400">
<p>The "Manage Simulation" menu has one tab. Clicking on it will reset the standings, track number, 
and any statistics recorded during the season
</p>
<img src = "Paint.png" alt = "Left list click" height = "200" width = "350">
<p>
There are two lists of drivers and car numbers. The left list displays the results from the last race
ran, while the right list displays the current standings. Clicking on a driver from the left list will
display the main paint scheme of the driver. All 40 drivers included in the game have a paint scheme.
</p>
<img src = "StandingsClick.png" alt = "Left list click" height = "200" width = "400">
<p>Clicking on a driver from the right list will bring up a variety of statistics about the driver. This 
includes name, sponsor, manufacturuer, team, and season statistics such as top 5 finishes, top 10 finishes,
wins, and average finish. Below this, there are several historical statistics such as rookie year and career 
wins. These will be updated as the season progresses.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3><u>Who made this program?</u></h3>
<p>This program was written by Dominik Bettini in 2016. There are several versions, including a Formula 1
simulator for the same year, but the version described here is the only surviving one.</p>
<h3><u>How was this program made?</u></h3>
<p>This program is coded in C# and made with VisualStudio.</p>
<h3><u>Why are my standings messed up?</u></h3>
<p>One of the oversights of this program is the fact that the user can disable the playoffs while they are happening.
If this happens, the standings will not be displayed correctly. It is reccomended that the chase option is enabled or disabled
at the beginning of the season.</p>
<h3><u>Why can't I run this program?</u></h3>
<p>You may have tried to run it on an outdated version of Windows, or with a Mac-OS system. Alternatively, you may have 
left the file unzipped.</p>
<h3><u>Why did my antivirus program flag this application?</u></h3>
<p>The application is a .exe file that does not have an author listed on it. This draws some red flags from antivirus softwares, but 
there is nothing harmful about this particular file.</p>
<h3><u>How can I contribute to this program?</u></h3>
<p>By updating the roster! Although the program is not being updated anymore, it can be edited freely in VisualBasic with 
new rosters.</p>
